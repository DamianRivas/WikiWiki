### For the full experience, upgrade to premium!

Create an account and click on your e-mail in the top-right corner and click on "Upgrade." It's in testing mode, so as long as you enter "4242 4242 4242 4242" as the credit card number and a future expiration date it will go through successfully.

Now you can create your own private wikis that only you can see! Also, you can add collaborators to your private wikis which will grant them the rights to view and edit your private wikis alongside you.

Give it a shot, create a private wiki and add `damian@example.com` as a collaborator.
